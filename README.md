# Task Management System For Overseas Engineers

This web application was developed in order to schedule and view the tasks of marine engineers. It has 2 main modules. The first module is task module and the second module is user module. Task module is use to create and view the tasks. User module is to create users with their engineering level. Here is a [demo](https://berkcetinsaya.com/TMSFOE).

## Usage

When you clone it, put the master folder to your web server directory. Then, import the taskManagement.sql file to your mysql database. By default, it will create a new database called as taskManagement with the tables. In case if it does not work, you can use taskManagementTables.sql to import only the tables into the database you created.

## Limitations

You are free to use this project. There is no limitation :)
